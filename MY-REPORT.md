1-liner description of your project

If you need to know the most valuable player in your basketball group, this service aims to do that through analysis of core concepts of what makes the best player on the court.

# Research Question 

* Being awarded the title of MVP in a sports game carries weight, especially in a pick-up basketball game. Being in a space where many players are waiting their turn to ball, being known as the best player can go a long way if you like to play often. Other players are much more likely to pick you for their team if you are known as the MVP.

* Many arguments can be made as to what qualities or traits define a most valuable player. Based on my own knowledge, I would say some core traits of an MVP on the public basketball court include -
  * Scoring ability - scoring often and consistently on attempts
  * Trustworthiness - decisions are trusted and respected by your teammates
  * Playing defense - making an effort when playing defense 

* My research aims to utilize generative AI prompt techniques to help in defining requirements for a service to determine an MVP based on recorded players and their player reports with statistics on playing ability and personality on the court. 

## Arguments

#### What is already known about this topic

* One could consult with a professional basketball expert who can analyze historical stats of many winning players and teams over the decades of the NBA. Knowledge from a career professional, subject matter expert could be trusted and leveraged in making the determination themselves.
* Many individual opinions could differ on the criteria for designation as MVP, introducing potential biases to the determination of such a player. 
* Since basketball has been played for over 100 years, patterns of MVPs in basketball players playing at a variety of skill levels can be acknowledged and presented in the decision making.
